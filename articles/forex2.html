                                    <b>Summary</b> <br>
                                    Emerging market currencies have outperformed over the first few weeks of 2023. In a historical context, the early-year rally emerging market currencies are experiencing has only been beaten twice in the last twelve years. We can attribute this outperformance to a Federal Reserve that is likely to slow the pace of monetary tightening as well as the re-opening of China's economy. Going forward, we believe emerging market currencies can continue to outperform; however, the path ahead may be bumpy. Financial markets are priced for Fed rate cuts that may not materialize, while the optimism around China's re-opening is likely to fade in the second half of this year. Overall however, we believe the positives outweigh the negatives, and expect attractive yield opportunities in the emerging markets and improving growth prospects abroad should continue to encourage market participants to allocate capital toward the emerging markets and be a pillar of support for developing currencies going forward
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>Less Hawkish Fed and China Re-opening Lifting Emerging Market FX</b><br>
                                    After a rough year in 2022, risk assets have performed relatively well so far in 2023. Equity indices around the world are in positive territory over the first few weeks of this year, while emerging market currencies are not only stronger against the U.S. dollar but outperforming G10 peers. For further context on the EM FX outperformance, through mid-January the J.P. Morgan emerging markets currency index is up a little under 2%. On the other hand, the G10 currencies via the U.S. dollar Advanced Foreign Economies index (a proxy for G10 foreign currency performance) is +1.1%. In fact, emerging market currencies are off to a historically strong start. To that point, since 2012, the J.P. Morgan EM FX index rose only 6 times over the first fourteen trading days of the year. Of those six years, except for 2012 and 2018, the index has risen more in 2023 than any other year (Figure 1).
                                    <br><br>
We can attribute the EM FX outperformance to two distinct dynamics unfolding in early 2023. The first—and in our view most important—is that Federal Reserve policymakers are likely to slow their pace of monetary tightening going forward. In the United States, inflation has demonstrated concrete signs of heading on a sustainable downward trajectory, and in response, Fed policymakers have signaled—and we now forecast—a 25 bps rate hike in February. Lifting the fed funds rate by 25 bps at the February meeting would represent a slower pace of hikes than policymakers previously pursued, and could be a sign that the Fed is nearing the end of its tightening cycle altogether. With the Fed likely to move at a more gradual pace of tightening going forward, U.S. Treasury yields have fallen precipitously to start this year. In fact, since 2012 two-year treasury yields have fallen six times over the first fourteen trading days of the year. 2023 marks the year when two-year yields have fallen the most, down close to 35 bps from the end of last year, reflecting a Fed that is turning less hawkish (Figure 2). As yields in the U.S. have come down, the relative attractiveness of U.S. Treasuries has declined and market participants have been attracted to higher yields found in the emerging markets. These portfolio and capital flows to emerging markets have supported developing currencies over the last few weeks.
<br><br>
Secondly, China lifting Zero-COVID policies and allowing for nationwide unrestricted mobility is improving sentiment toward emerging market currencies. Abandoning COVID-containment protocol began in late 2022, and while confirmed infections rose sharply in the immediate aftermath of the policy reversal, Chinese authorities forged ahead and have now completely dismantled Zero-COVID. Moving away from Zero-COVID happened much earlier than we expected, and has breathed new life into China's economic growth prospects for this year. We will do a full evaluation and update of our China GDP forecast in our February International Economic Outlook, but given China's sheer size and influence over the global economy, the outlook for global growth has also improved now that China is back up and running. In fairness, we still forecast global recession to materialize this year; however, a fully re-opened China introduces upside risks to our global growth forecast and the recession could now be less pronounced. This improved outlook for China as well as the global economy has inspired market participants to gather exposure to emerging market currencies, particularly the renminbi and currencies with a high degree of sensitivity to China. In just the last two months, the renminbi strengthened below the psychologically important 7.00 level down to around 6.75, while emerging Asian currencies and select commodity currencies have performed especially well.
<br><br>
In our view, the strong start for emerging market currencies can continue, although the road ahead may be a bit bumpy. As mentioned, we believe the Fed is likely to slow its pace of tightening, which could see U.S. yields on an overall downward trajectory over the course of this year. As yields move lower, the depreciation pressure that has weighed on the U.S. dollar should remain intact. As the U.S. dollar broadly depreciates, emerging market currencies should perform well and outperform relative to G10 peer currencies. However, financial markets are currently priced for Federal Reserve rate cuts to begin around the end of this year, something Fed officials have pushed back on. Should the Fed continue to dismiss the idea of easing monetary policy this year, emerging market currencies could experience sporadic bouts of volatility and depreciation. On balance, we believe a Fed that will eventually end its tightening cycle combined with still attractive yield opportunities in the developing world, should be enough to keep capital flowing toward the emerging markets.
<br><br>
In addition, at some point, likely in the second half of this year, the optimism around China's re-opening will start to fade. Financial markets will fully price China's growth prospects and the lift to EM FX from improved sentiment will dwindle. As these dynamics unfold and China reverts to trend-like quarterly growth rates, the tail-wind EM currencies are currently receiving from China should lessen. While China-induced positive sentiment may fade later this year, a return to trend-like growth rates does not necessarily mean sentiment toward China will turn negative, rather just neutral. And while emerging market currencies may need a new catalyst in the second half of the year, we ultimately believe China's re-opening is a net positive for growth across the emerging markets as well as for the global economy. As growth prospects improve in the emerging markets, especially at a time when the U.S. economy may be slipping into a modest and short-lived recession, we believe growth differentials should also be enough for investors to direct capital allocation to the emerging markets and local currency denominated assets.
