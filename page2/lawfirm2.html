                                    Law firms also employ paralegals who help lawyers draft, edit and organize legal documents in preparation for trials and hearings. Conversely, legal assistants mostly handle clerical tasks.

<br><br>
Medium Law Firms<br><br>

<br><br>
Large Law Firms<br><br>

<b>Law Firms by Legal Service</b><br><br>
