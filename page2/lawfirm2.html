                                    Law firms also employ paralegals who help lawyers draft, edit and organize legal documents in preparation for trials and hearings. Conversely, legal assistants mostly handle clerical tasks.

<br><br>
Medium Law Firms<br><br>
Medium-size firms offer personalized client service from partners like a small firm, with increased staffing and financial resources. Compared to large firms, the not-too-big-not-too-small firm usually means less prestige but with individual autonomy and a more strategic case load.
<br><br>
Large Law Firms<br><br>
The answer to the question “What is a large law firm?” focuses on the number of employees. Some of the largest law firms in the country have upward of 3,000 attorneysExternal link:open_in_new.

<b>Law Firms by Legal Service</b><br><br>

Litigation vs. Transactional Law Firms<br><br>

Transactional lawyersExternal link:open_in_new draft and review agreements, help structure deals and advise their clients.

Law firms employ non-equity partners, meaning a portion of their compensation is paid on a fixed basis in a salary, or equity partners, meaning they file a Schedule K-1 tax form and more than half their income is tied to commissions.

From there, one can become a managing equity partner who brings in clients, runs the business and inspires colleagues by implementing innovative solutions.
